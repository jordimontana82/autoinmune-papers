# Abstract

The aim of this study was to investigate the early-life development of the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis. Nineteen infants with atopic dermatitis and 19 healthy infants were evaluated 3 times, at 3 months intervals, within the first 30 months of life. Tape-strips were collected from volar forearms, cheeks, and eczema lesions, and the skin microbiome was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Both the community structure and richness of the skin microbiome of infants with atopic dermatitis differed significantly from that of healthy infants, with greater richness in healthy infants. For infants with atopic dermatitis, the community composition was not dominated by Staphylococci. For healthy infants, community composition and richness correlated significantly with age, while such a pattern was not revealed in subjects with atopic dermatitis. This suggests a slower maturation of the skin bacterial communities in atopic dermatitis, which precedes the staphylococcal predominance observed in older children and adults.
