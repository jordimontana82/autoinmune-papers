# README 

This static site is a a personal, curated, list of papers about autoinmune disease, with a focus on science-based non-pharmacological interventions like: dietary / nutrition interventions, lifestyle, gut microbiome and, pro/pre biotics, phytochemicals (herbal extracts), etc..

I use it primarily to keep track of some of the papers I read (and soon to be read) about certain autoinmune conditions so I don't forget anything :P

If it also helps you, then that's even better.
