# README 

This static site is a a personal, curated, list of papers about autoinmune disease, with a focus on science-based non-pharmacological interventions like: dietary / nutrition interventions, lifestyle, gut microbiome and, pro/pre biotics, phytochemicals (herbal extracts), etc..

I use it primarily to keep track of some of the papers I read (and soon to be read) about certain autoinmune conditions so I don't forget anything :P

If it also helps you, then that's even better.


## Building

This site is generated with Hugo and theme "PaperMod"

The main documentation for that theme lives at https://learn.netlify.app/en/

### Pulling latest
----------------------------------------
The docs depend on a git submodule that stores the files needed for the PaperMod theme

When pulling the repo for the first time, you might need to run the following command at the repo root's folder to get that theme :

    git submodule update --init --recursive


If there is a theme update, you might want to update it with:

    git submodule update --recursive --remote
